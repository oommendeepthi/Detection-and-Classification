# Detection-and-Classification


About the project
The proposed methodology can be completed in three steps and is responsible for the detection and classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)  and  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) stage. (1) Image preprocessing; (2) Transfer learning models and sparse autoencoder for feature extraction and size reduction; and (3) A multi-class categorization of illness stage using a finely tuned neural network. 
The Feature extraction with transferlearning model(5 models) and dimensionality reduction with autoencoder is given in one folder
The classification of stages achieved through DNN.
The dataset used for the work isobtained from ADNI database.
